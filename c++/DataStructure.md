### Binary space partition Tree

Binary space partition is a method for recursively subdividing a space into two convex sets by using hyperplanes as partitions. This process of subdividing gives rise to a representation of objects within the space in the form of a tree data structure known as a BSP tree.

### K Dimensional Tree

A K-D Tree is a binary search tree where data in each node is a K-Dimensional point in space. It is a space partitioning data structure for organizing points in a K-Dimension space.
