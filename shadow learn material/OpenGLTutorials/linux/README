README:
-------

Binaries for computers in 4220 and 4225 are included (see linux/lib). If you
run this on a different system, you may have to rebuild DevIL and GLEW for that
system. 

This assumes that your directory tree is as follows (seen from $PATH/TO/labs)

  ./
  	./lab2-textures            \
	./lab3-camera              |  Lab-projects
	...                        |
	./lab6-shadowmaps          /

	./glutil                   } gl-related utilities & stuff

	./inc                      \
	./bin                      |  Windows-related files
	[other windows files]      /

	./linux                         \
	  ./linux/lib                   |
	  ./linux/lib64                 |
	  ./linux/include               | Linux-related files
	  ./linux/DevIL-1.7.8.tar.gz    |
	  ./linux/glew-1.5.1-src.tgz    /

- Building DevIL:

 $ tar xvfz DevIL-1.7.8.tar.gz
 $ cd devil-1.7.8
 $ ./configure --prefix="$(cd .. && pwd)" --enable-ILU --enable-ILUT
 $ make && make install

- Building GLEW
 
 $ tar xvfz glew-1.5.1-src.tgz
 $ cd glew
 $ dos2unix config/config.guess
 $ make GLEW_DEST=".." && make install GLEW_DEST=".."

(Note: if you use a different version of GLEW, you can maybe skip the third step)
